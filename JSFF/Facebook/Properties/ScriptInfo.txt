Script Information
===============================================================================

This assembly provides access to script APIs. This is only meant for use at
development time, so you can reference and compile your c# code against the
script APIs. You must include the appropriate scripts in your page for
runtime functionality.

# TODO: You can use this file to describe which version of the script
#       your import library is based on, the URLs of associated scripts
#       or any particular usage information for including those scripts
#       into the application.
